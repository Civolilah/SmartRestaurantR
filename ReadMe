Heyyyy,

I hope you are doing well.

Steps for starting the project:

1. Cloning the project on your device
2. Opening it with the Visual Studio 2019
3. Using Microsoft SQL 2018 for database migrations

Click "Debug" on your top-bar in Visual Studio and than "Start without debuging".

That is all you need to start my project.

I hope you will enjoy in using my project.
Abedin
